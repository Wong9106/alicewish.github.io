&lt;p&gt;Ten Cats&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ten abandoned cats live in an old warehouse where they are looked after by a young girl named Annie. They include Chesney, the ringleader, Jack, his sidekick, and Oliver&amp;ndash;a wide-eyed kitten. The warehouse contains a boardroom on the very top floor, where, unbeknownst to Annie the kitties conduct the world&amp;rsquo;s business through the eyes of a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Ten Cats, created by Graham Harrop, won the National Cartoonist&amp;rsquo;s Society Award for the Best Online Comics&amp;ndash;Short Form division.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Skin Horse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in this great nation is a top-secret government agency in charge of providing aid to America&amp;rsquo;s nonhuman citizenry.  Perpetually overworked and underpaid, these dedicated civil servants soldier on with a dedication exceeded only by their respective passions for heavy rifles, stylish footwear, and good sturdy squeaky toys.  They&amp;rsquo;re not our country&amp;rsquo;s best nor our country&amp;rsquo;s brightest, but to all the lost and lonely creations of misguided science wandering the wild places of this country, they are a beacon of minimum-wage hope.  This is their story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thatababy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thatababy&amp;rsquo;s philosophy can be summed up quite neatly: To keep his parents on their toes. This new comic strip stars - well, a baby, of course, and the mother and father in charge of raising him. Thatababy&amp;rsquo;s premise is as fun and instantly accessible as its crisp, colorful art: It&amp;rsquo;s a baby&amp;rsquo;s job to drive parent&amp;rsquo;s crazy. You may recognize Thatababy as a finalist and runner-up in the Amazon Comic Strip Superstar contest that ran on Amazon.com in the fall of 2009. Thatababy received glowing reviews from the contest&amp;rsquo;s celebrity panel of judges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Prickly City&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small town in the American Southwest&amp;hellip; everything in the desert is designed to prick you, wound you or eat you. What better metaphor for 21st century Earth? Prickly City is a comic strip about the friendship between Winslow, a coyote pup, and Carmen, a straight and narrow kind of kid. Prickly City offers a conservative perspective on political and social events within an ongoing storyline. As Carmen might say, &amp;ldquo;We may not be correct but we will always be right.&amp;rdquo; Their high jinks provide endless laughs as Winslow gets into trouble and Carmen follows. Join Carmen and Winslow for their adventures in the desert! In the e-book original Fifty Shades of Politics, Winslow runs for president and skewers the whole electoral process along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Phoebe and Her Unicorn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year has passed since Phoebe skipped a rock across a pond, accidentally hit a unicorn in the face, and was granted a single wish—which she used to make the unicorn, Marigold Heavenly Nostrils, her obligational best friend. In some ways, not much has changed. At school Phoebe still clashes with her rival&amp;ndash;and sometimes &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;frenemy&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;he ever-taunting and imperious Dakota. Outside of school, she still fills her free time with extra-credit homework assignments, dramatic monologues about the injustices associated with school cliques, and imaginative conspiracy theories regarding global forces like the &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;powerful construction paper lobby.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; But unlike before, Phoebe now has a best friend to share it with—someone to make her laugh and to listen to all her extravagant ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this second volume of Heavenly Nostrils, titled, Unicorn on a Roll, the reader is invited on a journey into the lives of Phoebe and Marigold as they navigate the difficulties of grade school, celebrate the winter holidays, and explore their super hero/super villain personas together. Join in the fun, as Phoebe competes against Dakota for the leading role of &amp;ldquo;Lisa Ladybug&amp;rdquo; in their fourth-grade play—or as she struggles to &amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; the PR debacle related to her nose-picking-scandal. (&amp;ldquo;I will neither confirm nor deny the events surrounding Boogergate.&amp;rdquo;) Witness a band of unicorns staging an &amp;ldquo;intervention&amp;rdquo; and learn all the details of Marigold&amp;rsquo;s secret crush on a mysterious creature she has never seen. Perhaps most important, watch as this surprising friendship between a charming, nine-year-old dreamer and a vain, mythical beast forever changes both of them for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dilbert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dilbert first appeared in newspapers across the country in 1989, office workers looked around suspiciously. Was its creator, Scott Adams, a pen name for someone who worked amongst them? After all, the humor was just too eerily funny and familiar. Since then, Dilbert has become more than a cartoon character. He&amp;rsquo;s become an office icon. No one delivers more laughs or captures the reality of the 9 to 5 worker better than Dilbert, Dogbert, Catbert, and a cast of stupefying office stereotypes&amp;ndash;which is why there are millions of fans of the Dilbert comic strip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Big Top&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harrell&amp;rsquo;s work combines pop culture, innocence, friendship, and some of the seamier side of the circus background that only adults can appreciate. Come one! Come all &amp;hellip; to the exciting world of Big Top! Rob Harrell&amp;rsquo;s three-ring comic strip has already packed the house with fans eager for his hilarious take on the circus and those who bring it to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circus and its colorful cast &amp;ndash; led by 10-year-old Pete and his happily reformed performing bear, Wink &amp;ndash; are a perfect metaphor for life. It&amp;rsquo;s not always what happens on the surface, Big Top reminds us, but what takes place backstage that delivers the lessons and the humor. Pete and Wink keep plenty of odd company, including Kingston, coolest king of the jungle; Stucco, a mute clown who still manages to make his point; Manfred, the bookish monkey; Dusty, the wisecracking tell-it-like-it-is trained poodle; Andrea, the new acrobat girl who&amp;rsquo;s caught Pete&amp;rsquo;s eye; and Hairy Mary the Bearded Lady, a mother figure to them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this crew on the road and you get an endless array of situations and relationships, care and impatience, honesty and intolerance. It&amp;rsquo;s like one big Big Top family &amp;hellip; one that welcomes all readers for the mere price of a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Flying McCoys&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This zany strip enters the comic-collection scene with circus-like zeal. All that&amp;rsquo;s missing is a parade of elephants and a clown-car escort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary and Glenn McCoy&amp;rsquo;s delightfully absurd comic panel blends superheroes, office humor, huggable animals, and twisted relationships in a bizarre marriage of Gary Larson, the New Yorker, Conan O&amp;rsquo;Brien, and Mad Magazine. Put succinctly, the brothers McCoy present &amp;ldquo;comics for a bold new world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a world where greeting cards heal hospital patients, police officers pull over children driving bumper cars, babies use the patch to quell the pacifier habit, and nudists find out what constitutes a streaker in their colony, the St. Louis area natives alternate writing and drawing duties for the daily panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brothers each have been nominated for multiple National Cartoonists Society awards, and Glenn has won in three categories. Gary McCoy&amp;rsquo;s past as a comedian (he won HBO&amp;rsquo;s Stand-Up Stand-Off contest for the St. Louis area in 1995) also shines through in the strip&amp;rsquo;s offbeat humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their impressive freelance client list reads like a who&amp;rsquo;s who in cartooning: Disney, DreamWorks, and Hyperion, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Cynical, no nonsense Elvis and shy, sweet, sensitive Puck are the reporter kitties in the field, while the adventurous jokester Lupin serves as anchor cat. Together they break headlines on the food bowl, new plants, mysterious red dots, strange cats in the yard, and all the daily happenings in their home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;WuMo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cartoon WuMo celebrates life&amp;rsquo;s absurdity and bittersweet ironies, holding up a funhouse mirror to our modern world and those who live in it. Thanks to its delightful artwork and irreverent humor, this hilarious comic by writer Mikael Wulff and illustrator Anders Morgenthaler has grown from an underground sensation to one of the biggest and most popular strips in Europe.WuMo&amp;rsquo;s inventiveness is reminiscent of their countryman Hans Christian Andersen&amp;ndash;if Andersen&amp;rsquo;s fairy tales had been populated by sadistic pandas, disgruntled office workers, crazy beavers, Albert Einstein, Snoop Dogg, and Darth Vader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Named WuMo, after the Danish duo&amp;rsquo;s last names, it appears in the largest papers in northern Europe, including Germany&amp;rsquo;s Die Welt, Denmark&amp;rsquo;s Politiken, and Norway&amp;rsquo;s Dagbladet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Pickles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second fan letter I have written in my whole life. The other one was to Hopalong Cassidy, when I had a great crush on him at about six years old. But I did want to let you know how very much both my husband and I have enjoyed Pickles from the very first strip. Would you please consider putting a collection together in book form?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Lois F. in Nevada&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its loyal fans will gladly tell you, Pickles has been a zinger-filled, laugh-out-loud gem since its debut in 1990. Since then, it has steadily climbed in popularity, and today appears in over 400 newspapers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still Pickled After All These Years collects strips from this sweet intergenerational comic that alternates point of view between an older married couple, a 30-something married couple, and their son. The strip centers on Earl and Opal Pickles, who have been married over 50 years but inject plenty of spunk and insight into everything they do. Whether they&amp;rsquo;re taking a wry but sympathetic glance at their divorced daughter, Sylvia, laughing at their faithful but feckless canine, Roscoe, marveling at their dictatorial feline, Muffin, or just commenting on the little things in life, Earl and Opal&amp;rsquo;s good-natured wit and dry humor is brilliantly on target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pickles is about growing old and keeping your sense of humor but never forgetting what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a child. The strip&amp;rsquo;s inaugural AMP collection, Still Pickled After All These Years, encapsulates the importance of staying close to those who bring you the most joy and reminds everyone about the incalculable value of the unconditional love of pets, family, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In The Bleachers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of sports is tough, competitive, and often hysterical. Steve Moore highlights the humor of sports and creates moments of absurdity in his comic strip In the Bleachers. In this e-book original compilation, the sport of baseball is lampooned on and off the field. From an umpire-vaporizing homemade laser to an all-too-true riff on the inexpiable infield fly rule, the ironic illustrations that Steve Moore is known for make good fun our of America&amp;rsquo;s pastime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latest compilation of In the Bleachers features Steve Moore&amp;rsquo;s unique comedic style that has propelled his career from journalism to TV/feature film animation. He has had huge success in the industry with two animated feature films and 26 animated shorts for ESPN. Moore&amp;rsquo;s success has not diminished his devotion to his comic strip as he continues to draw from his experience to give each of his comics a fresh and hilarious take on sports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Candorville&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darrin Bell&amp;rsquo;s Candorville is an insightful comic strip for today&amp;rsquo;s world. Brutally honest but still evenhanded, Candorville takes on some of society&amp;rsquo;s toughest issues, giving readers something to think about&amp;ndash;as well as smirks, chuckles, and guffaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Stereotype Bites the Dust is a collection of creator Darrin Bell&amp;rsquo;s Candorville cartoon strip. In this thought-provoking strip Bell uses a diverse group of friends to paint a real yet humorous portrait of inner-city America. An educated underachiever, Lemont Brown is an aspiring writer. Socially conscious, he wants to work at changing the world and infusing it with wisdom and justice&amp;ndash;if only he could pay his rent. Lemont&amp;rsquo;s childhood friend Susan Garcia is a book-smart and street savvy Mexican-American woman who won&amp;rsquo;t let bigotry or any glass ceiling keep her down. And Lemont&amp;rsquo;s friend Clyde (aka C-Dog) is a streetwise thug and undiscovered rapper who&amp;rsquo;d rather mooch off his mother than get a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Stereotype Bites the Dust deals with some tough issues&amp;ndash;poverty, homelessness, racism, and personal responsibility&amp;ndash;with knowing irony and incisive satire. Bell uses edgy dialogue and modern situations to jab everything from political correctness to political spinning, from political hindsight to office politics, making it a hit with the socially aware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pairing vintage comic art with hilarious, new dialog by Disney veteran writer John Lustig, Last Kiss revels in the absurdities of love, lust and &amp;lsquo;life with lip.&amp;rsquo; The series originated when Lustig bought the publishing rights to a romance comic book series from the 50&amp;rsquo;s and 60&amp;rsquo;s, and started rewriting the stories for fun. Since then, the re-dialogued comics have been a popular feature in newspapers, magazines, comic books and greeting cards. Today Last Kiss is gaining popularity and is also available on email cards from Jib Jab and greeting cards from NobleWorks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Non Sequitur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;254-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a cartoonist successfully captures life&amp;rsquo;s humorous and ironic moments in three short panels, readers applaud. When Wiley does the same in his single-scene format, they roll on the carpet laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non Sequitur not only breaks the three-panel mold, it succeeds without regular characters, standard settings, or repeat situations to fall back on. Each piece, in other words, hangs out there as Wiley&amp;rsquo;s snapshot of the worlds of work, leisure, and life&amp;rsquo;s many crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non Sequitur&amp;rsquo;s Beastly Things, as guided by Rolf the dog, keeps readers howling, growling, and scratching for more. You will delight, for instance, in crocodiles luring fishermen with dollar bills, Randy the science lab kid who announces that his homework ate his dog, and the desert dweller who celebrates the change of season by raking needles beneath his cacti.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Marmaduke&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marmaduke is America&amp;rsquo;s most lovable Great Dane. Created by Brad Anderson, the classic comic canine has delighted newspaper readers since 1954. Marmaduke lives with the Winslow family, who, try as they might, just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get him to obey. Despite his antics, the playful pooch is top dog in the neighborhood and on the comics page, where he has endeared himself to readers in more than 20 countries. The daily panel also strikes a chord with pet owners, many of whom write to Anderson to comment on Marmaduke as if he were a real dog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boy&amp;rsquo;s imagination is unleashed in Lio&amp;rsquo;s Astonishing Tales: From the Haunted Crypt of Unknown Horrors. The 2009 National Cartoonists Award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip, Lio is unique in its pantomime content and drawing style. This treasury includes creator commentary and origins of Lio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s slightly dark and terribly funny. Lio, the main character, a young boy with an imagination that has no limit, explores everything kid. From bumps in the night to things hiding under the bed, readers get an inside look at different shades of humor but always come out the other end unscathed and laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lio is brilliant!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Dallas Morning News&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ziggy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ziggy must be part of me, because he feels as if he&amp;rsquo;s been with me all my life.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Tom Wilson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter where you are, no matter what&amp;rsquo;s going on in your life, Ziggy has been there. For the past 35 years, readers around the world have picked up newspapers, opened greeting card envelopes, or caught sight of T-shirts and there&amp;rsquo;s Ziggy, unfailingly showing how to appreciate life and find the silver lining in any cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Wilson&amp;rsquo;s character&amp;ndash;an admirable mix of Ben Franklin, Dale Carnegie, and Forrest Gump all rolled into a little bald icon&amp;ndash;strikes a chord in everyone. And that&amp;rsquo;s why so many will cherish A Little Character Goes a Long Way, a celebration of Ziggy himself. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s the character of this character that&amp;rsquo;s earned Ziggy such a special place in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This treasury includes many classic Ziggy frames and strips, each highlighting the traits that make Ziggy the upbeat, hopeful, and unflappable optimist that he is. There&amp;rsquo;s Ziggy generally making molehills and wrinkles out of life&amp;rsquo;s highest mountains and lowest valleys; Ziggy and his menagerie of pets; and Ziggy taking the time to appreciate nature&amp;rsquo;s beauty at its best. This little Everyperson reminds us all of what&amp;rsquo;s really important, and this treasury will undoubtedly do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Get Fuzzy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the comics scene of late, Get Fuzzy has made the fur fly.  This freshly amusing strip has rapidly become the new darling among readers who enjoy pets with an attitude. This wry cartoon features Rob Wilco, a mild-mannered ad guy who&amp;rsquo;s guardian to two rambunctious pets: Bucky, a temperamental cat who carries a boom box and goes on spending sprees, and Satchel, a gentle canine who tries to remain neutral even when he bears the brunt of Bucky&amp;rsquo;s mischief. Together, this unlikely trio hangs out together, watching TV, cooking for friends, and attempting the occasional adventure outside. Anyone who has a pet or even knows one will find this Get Fuzzy collection, The Dog is Not a Toy, an astutely witty take on relationships between the species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Frazz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Frazz, your typical Renaissance man-successful songwriter, talented triathlete, and elementary school janitor. Okay, maybe Frazz isn&amp;rsquo;t quite that typical, and this is exactly why the students at Bryson Elementary School love him. Frazz&amp;rsquo;s bantering and philosophizing with students is always witty and sharp, yet accessible and enriching. He&amp;rsquo;s also made a name for himself amongst the school&amp;rsquo;s faculty &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s captured the admiration of Principal Spaetzle, the romantic affections of first-grade teacher Miss Plainwell, and the exasperation of cynical Mrs. Olsen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A Tangled Web&amp;rdquo; is an digital original collection of cartoons that showcases the funniest of shenanigans that ensue between Frazz and Bryson Elementary&amp;rsquo;s students and faculty alike. This compilation includes exclusive commentary from Frazz&amp;rsquo;s creator, Jef Mallet himself. Mallet&amp;rsquo;s work was nominated by the National Cartoonists Society for a Reuben division award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip in 2004, and Frazz has won two Wilbur Awards in 2003 and 2005, which honors excellence in communicating values and ethics. Indeed, within Frazz&amp;rsquo;s jokes and antics is the heart of the strip: insight that makes learning fun for kids and inevitable for adults.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Crankshaft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He blusters and grumbles. He rants and raves. He tries to outgun the school kids chasing after the bus on his route.  But in his heart, Ed Crankshaft has a decent streak a mile wide. Patiently explaining death to his grandson Max. Comforting his friend Ralph as Ralph&amp;rsquo;s wife descends into Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s. Thrusting flowers and candy at his son-in-law on a nearly forgotten wedding anniversary. The star of the hit comic strip Crankshaft is a gentle soul stuck in a cantankerous mood. With a supporting cast that includes Ed&amp;rsquo;s two daughters, Chris and Pam; Pam&amp;rsquo;s husband, Jeff; and their kids, Max and Mindy, Crankshaft appeals to families everywhere who steadfastly deal with intergenerational cares and conflicts. As one critic said: &amp;ldquo;Crankshaft is a witty, thoughtful commentary on the trials and tribulations of today&amp;rsquo;s senior citizens.&amp;rdquo; But, of course, Crankshaft is so much more. The strip&amp;rsquo;s approach to Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s generated countless letters and e-mails, as did Crankshaft&amp;rsquo;s near-death illness. Hilarious and clever, honest and moving, Crankshaft both keeps readers laughing at the curmudgeon&amp;rsquo;s pranks and pondering life&amp;rsquo;s real meaning in this collection, Your Favorite&amp;hellip;Crab Cakes! It&amp;rsquo;s a balancing act that&amp;rsquo;s rarely attempted in the comics&amp;ndash;and with Crankshaft, it works admirably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Zits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of sixteen-year-old Jeremy Duncan revolves around his insatiable &amp;ldquo;growing boy&amp;rdquo; appetite, lip-locking with squeeze Sarah, keeping his jerry-rigged vehicle roadworthy, and playing with his band, Goat Cheese Pizza. Somewhere in the background, he&amp;rsquo;s vaguely aware of some muted voices, constantly beseeching him to pick up his Matterhorn-sized clothes pile, to be home on time (so lame!), and to (God forbid!) communicate with them. The disembodied voices are those of Connie and Walt, his mostly patient, but sometimes frustrated to exploding, parents. In Zits, they portray a hilarious view of coping with a teenager and with being a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created in 1997 by Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Jim Borgman and Reuben Award-winning cartoonist/writer Jerry Scott, Zits appears in more than 1,600 newspapers worldwide in 45 countries and is translated into 15 different languages. The comic has an estimated daily readership of more than 200 million readers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Stone Soup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan Eliot&amp;rsquo;s funny and irreverent Stone Soup follows the saga of an extended, blended family, starring two working-mom sisters living just across the fence from each other. Val and Joan share life with their opinionated mother, a middle-school diva and 10-year-old tomboy, a reclusive teenage boy, a wild preschooler and his new baby sister&amp;hellip;and of course Wally, the ultimate nice guy who steps into his stepdad shoes with grace amid the chaos. Working-parent hassles, pre-school tantrums, middle-school angst, love and the single mom&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s all here in Stone Soup. In It&amp;rsquo;s Hard to Be Holly, the angst of being an adolescent is felt through the hardships of actually having to work in school and, ugh!, going camping with the entire family!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Rubes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his comic strip, Rubes, cartoonist and &amp;ldquo;sit-down&amp;rdquo; comedian Leigh Rubin takes a careful look at everyday situations and human nature&amp;ndash;and then pokes fun at them. The result is a hilarious and often uncannily accurate exploration of our crazy life and times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featuring favorite Rubes cartoons handpicked by Rubin himself, The Wild and Twisted World of Rubes is a best-of collection that serves as a wonderful introduction to the comic strip People magazine calls &amp;ldquo;sneakily funny.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syndicated internationally by Creators Syndicate, Rubes is one of the most popular single-panel cartoons in the country. Rubes appears daily in more than 400 newspapers and is also featured each week as &amp;ldquo;Rubes Friday Funnies&amp;rdquo; on the long-running, nationally broadcast program AgDay. Leigh&amp;rsquo;s blog, Tales from a Twisted Mind, is a consistent favorite on AgWeb and draws in tens of thousands of readers each month. Rubes is also featured in calendars as well as on T-shirts and greeting cards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Pearls Before Swine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart, Pearls Before Swine is the comic strip tale of two friends: an arrogant Rat who thinks he knows it all and a slow-witted Pig who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know any better. Together, this pair offers caustic commentary on humanity&amp;rsquo;s quest for the unattainable. Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams says that Pearls is &amp;ldquo;one of the few comics that make me laugh out loud.&amp;rdquo; The strip has twice won the National Cartoonists Society&amp;rsquo;s Reuben division award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip - in 2003 and in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Real Life Adventures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs, bosses, garden slugs, who sits next to who at Thanksgiving, cheating at golf, fretting the night away, carping couples on long trips, eating over the sink, toenail clippings, cosmic order, hairballs, flop sweat, coughing into one&amp;rsquo;s elbow, clogged pipes, clogged arteries, parking crooked at the mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what real life is all about. And that&amp;rsquo;s what Real Life Adventures is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly two decades, Lance Aldrich and Gary Wise have drawn, and drawn from, the everyday stuff that we all slog through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on any given day, they like to think their little square slice of life is a nice change from the rickety roller coaster the rest of the world seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Pooch Cafe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pooch Cafe&amp;rsquo; is creator Paul Gilligan&amp;rsquo;s first syndicated strip, and this book collects the strips from its successful first year of syndication. When Poncho&amp;rsquo;s beloved master Chazz marries cat lover Carmen and forces them to move in with her and her feline brood, Poncho&amp;rsquo;s world is shaken to the core. Carmen&amp;rsquo;s attempts to bribe Poncho with cheese cannot overcome his inexplicable but undeniable disdain for all things cat, and now that his home has become a haven for them, his only recourse is to seek refuge in the cafe, where he, Boomer, and his other canine pals pore over their top-secret plans to construct a giant catapult with which to hurl all the Earth&amp;rsquo;s cats into the sun. As much as he dislikes kitties, he&amp;rsquo;s equally passionate about his love for Chazz. Poncho will do just about anything to keep his position as man&amp;rsquo;s best friend secure, including enduring the physical torments of Chazz&amp;rsquo;s passion for biking, camping, and mountain climbing, which he can only get through with the help of classic Russian literature and a nice cup of tea. Pooch Cafe&amp;rsquo; captures the intensity of the human-dog bond in a way that will resonate with pet lovers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What do you get when you combine a hot Aussie and an insecure Luann? Awkwardness, with a capital AWK. And what happens when the hot girl, Tiffany, digs her claws into the hot guy? Then what happens when the hot guy has to go back to Australia? If awkwardness is funny, then this saga is hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;FoxTrot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAAA! That&amp;rsquo;s the sound heard often from the the Fox siblings as only sister Paige discovers Quincy the iguana has eaten her homework, older brother Peter applies permanent marker on his face drawing a fake goatee, and younger brother and expert video gamer Jason loses to Paige.  Throw in the AAAAs as mother Andy exclaims while dodging thrown balls in the house and backyard-grilling disaster dad Roger blows up another grill, and you have the perfect equation for a family that every kid can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including cartoons from previously published books, this kid-targeted book portrays a not so typical look at how a year unfolds in the Fox family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Dog Eat Doug&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re talking cute, but with a Calvin and Hobbes-ian twist.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Mike Wilson, features editor, St. Petersburg Times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Snoopy and Charlie Brown, or Calvin and Hobbes, please welcome Sophie and Doug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dog Eat Doug is the cartooning creation of Brian Anderson that follows the daily exploits of Sophie, a cheese-loving chocolate Lab with a nose for the nuances of sarcasm and irony, and baby Doug, a healthy, happy newborn with no concept of jealousy and a limitless curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, this dynamic duo adjusts to sharing the spotlight, the toys, and the affections of Mom and Dad, while exploring nature and its majesty, the couch and its cushions, and the cookie jar and its contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first Dog Eat Doug collection, this book features 43 weeks&amp;rsquo; worth of strips beginning with the cartoon&amp;rsquo;s 2005 debut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Close to Home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;143-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with an everyday occurrence, add several helpings of absurdity, a few cups of silliness, and a dash of sickness and you get Close to Home. The goofy people and brilliant humor of this single-panel strip have put smiles on the faces of readers. This kooky collection, Close to Home Exposed, captures the hilarity of some of its best cartoon panels. As the comic&amp;rsquo;s name suggests, Close to Home provides humor that&amp;rsquo;s comfortable and familiar; yet the strip also has a palpable element of danger or nonsense. Topics vary widely, from health care and parenting to car repairs and shopping. But whether it&amp;rsquo;s addressing dating or death&amp;ndash;or just as likely, dating and death&amp;ndash;Close to Home always delivers the off-center laughs its readers have come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Close to Home is always a scream, and I love the goofy people that you draw. Truth is, I work with a lot of these folks.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Tom D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where do you come up with these comics&amp;rsquo;! They are totally stupendous and are a big part of my stupid and nauseating life. You&amp;rsquo;re the best!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Sleepless in New York&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every day you make me laugh!! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;An Online Fan&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hungry? Did somebody say hungry? Yes, says Garfield, who is always hungry for lasagna and is always looking for trouble. In this first-ever Spanish collection especially curated for middle-grade readers, Garfield shares that he is also always hungry for fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garfield appears in thirty-two newspapers in Mexico and Central and South America, including Ecuador, Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam@home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;129-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Brian Basset first created his strip, Adam, it had a Mr. Mom theme running through it. It was unusual at the time for a man to stay home while his wife played the corporate games &amp;ndash; even if he was working &amp;ndash; and Basset used the situation to its fullest comic potential. These days, however, home-based offices are increasingly common, and Basset finds he was merely leading a trend. That&amp;rsquo;s one reason the creator of this charming cartoon changed the name of his strip last year to Adam@home. In this sixth collection, the one-time Mr. Mom focuses on a whole host of compatriots who hang out at the local coffee cafe, log in remotely, and compare work-at-home notes. In Cafe Adam, an all-new Adam@home collection, Basset mines the laughs in all sorts of home-office and coffee-house-based dramas, including keeping in good standing with the local barista (no jokes about the nose ring), dealing with client complaints by handing over the phone to a screaming infant son, and helping out his kids&amp;rsquo; class at school. He also revels in the little things, from changes the nearby Kopyko made for workers like himself to being able to attend an office Christmas party, even if it&amp;rsquo;s virtual.Through it all, Adam&amp;rsquo;s wife, Laura, who still has to show up for her job at a local bookstore, and his kids, Katy, Clayton, and Nick, help the Newman household retain its balance. An engaging family, the Newmans have become an essential source of amusement for Basset&amp;rsquo;s countless fans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Lunarbaboon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunarbaboon shares life&amp;rsquo;s parenting moments from the perspective of a 30-something dad/husband/chaos survivor. Together with the savvy, laid back Mom, wild child Moishe, baby Matilda, and a former Julliard student (their cat), Lunarbaboon must navigate the family and social dynamics of everyday life. Ranging from the hilarious (defeating closet monsters with a &amp;ldquo;stun&amp;rdquo; blaster that offers surprising facts about bears, Mars, and cats) to the sweet (the gray scale-to color transition out of depression at the touch of a loved one), this collection explores the bonds within a family and all the characters who bring both order and chaos to life.Lunarbaboon&amp;rsquo;s perfect meld of crabby humor and moments of impactful honesty give these comics a wide range and distinctive voice that&amp;rsquo;s both comical and sincere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;La Cucaracha&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;129-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An anthropomorphic hipster cockroach is on the cutting-edge of American comic-strip humor. La Cucaracha (aka Cuco Rocha) and his pals voice the concerns and observations of the Latino-American community with an edgy, insightful wit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through La Cucaracha, creator Lalo Alcaraz makes blunt social commentary both hard-hitting and hilarious. The result is not just a pleasure, but also a craving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong undercurrent of modern Latino themes and issues adds a sharp layer of meaning to the humor. In one strip, an immigrant bartender has listened to two customers rant, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m telling ya, there&amp;rsquo;s too many immigrants pouring into this country.&amp;rdquo; When one of the customers asks for another drink the bartender declares, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m an immigrant, and guess what? I&amp;rsquo;m not pouring!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first of perceptive La Cucaracha humor will delight and gratify all audiences that appreciate intelligent, progressive, deeply amusing comics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Actual events may provide plenty of grist for the cartoon mill, but it takes a mind like Garry Trudeau&amp;rsquo;s to sift through it for the hilarious kernel of truth. From the Bill Clinton-Ken Starr face-off to high-flying Internet start-ups to new ways to plagiarize term papers, Trudeau hones in on the things we take so seriously and livens them up with craftyjolts of jocularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Doonesbury retains its fresh and innovative style. Doonesbury has, over the years, tweaked everything and nearly everyone, from Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s aggressive real estate style to Dan Quayle&amp;rsquo;s unblinking stance on family values to Newt Gingrich&amp;rsquo;s ticking-time-bomb technique, while keeping us entertained with characters including Boopsie, Duke, J.J., B.D., and Earl. Doonesbury is always provocative, controversial, and hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For Better or For Worse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;193-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bleak day when the Patterson&amp;rsquo;s faithful 14-year-old sheep dog, Farley, died while saving young April from a raging river. Across the country, fans who read For Better or For Worse in some 1,600 daily newspapers reacted with surprise and grief. Since 1979, Johnston has created an affectionate family whose members face real problems with grace and humor. Readers have accompanied Elly and John Patterson through the years, watching them raise their children, Michael, Elizabeth, and April; commiserating when they dealt with aging parents; wondering how they&amp;rsquo;d handle a friend&amp;rsquo;s homosexuality. In Remembering Farley, Lynn Johnston shares her favorite selections from the heroic sheep dog&amp;rsquo;s life. This retrospective includes strips from Farley&amp;rsquo;s puppy days to his dying day, scenes that capture the essence of raising and loving a pet. Remembering Farley also contains some new illustrations and quotes from some of the letters sent by Farley&amp;rsquo;s many fans. Remembering Farley is a tender tribute to a dog that many of us felt was our own devoted friend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Cul de Sac&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;144-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Richard Thompson, creator of the cartoon strip Cul de Sac, learned that he had Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, the entire cartoon community was moved. From other cartoonists to fans, the urge to &amp;ldquo;do something&amp;rdquo; was overwhelming. Enter Chris Sparks, friend of and webmaster for Richard, who came up with the idea of joining the Team Fox effort. Having read two of Michael J. Fox&amp;rsquo;s books, he knew about the foundation, which made him think of creating a Team Cul de Sac to honor Richard and to raise money for and awareness about PD. He set up the team with the foundation and began the quest to create a book that contributors would donate their original art to be included in the book and to be auctioned off later. All of the auction&amp;rsquo;s and a portion of the book&amp;rsquo;s profits will be donated to Team Fox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response to Chris&amp;rsquo;s call for art has been impressive. From indie cartoonists to noted syndicated, editorial, and magazine cartoonists to graphic novel artists, illustrators, and sheer Cul de Sac fans, the assortment of cartoon styles paying homage to Cul de Sac and Richard Thompson in Team Cul de Sac is truly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Argyle Sweater&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;244-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Hilburn&amp;rsquo;s The Argyle Sweater boasts a readership ranging from the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times to the Calgary Herald, and more than 1 million Argyle Sweater greeting cards have been sold. Inside Hilburn&amp;rsquo;s colorful cartoon panel, oversized animals, malevolent Care Bears, and an unstable Hamburger Helper cavort with bees, wolves, zebras, cavemen, mad scientists, and nursery-rhyme and funny-page icons to offer a critique of society and popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captured with Hilburn&amp;rsquo;s visceral talent and bold pen stroke, The Argyle Sweater is a celebrated visual and cerebrally astute panel fueled by thoughtful imagination and a skewered attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Soup to Nutz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;128-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nutz family will never be confused with the Waltons, the Partridges, or the Bradys. But you might confuse them with another family: your own. Soup To Nutz: The First Course is the first collection of comic strips featuring the off-kilter Nutz family, where the battle for the last chicken leg rivals the Battle of Bull Run and sibling &amp;ldquo;rivalry&amp;rdquo; is putting it mildly. The battling brood includes brothers Roy-boy and Andrews, their sister and middle child Babs, parents Roy and Pat, and their faithful dog Rosco. These six Nutz make up a family that is every bit as funny and screwball as their name implies. Roy-boy teases his younger brother by telling him that he became part of the family when they found him in the woods and adopted him. But his sister is quick to set the record straight: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be silly, Andrew, you weren&amp;rsquo;t adopted &amp;hellip; Dad made you out of wood and a cricket turned you into a real boy.&amp;rdquo; The irreverent humor of Nutz flows from the pencil of creator Rick Stromoski, whose research includes growing up the seventh member of a family of 12 children. That experience no doubt helped shape the humor behind what is one of the funniest up-and-coming strips on the funny pages today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Ink Pen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;129-Pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ink Pen never runs out of insights into the seedy underbelly of cartoon character employment. Dunlap has a truly unique perspective and storytelling style about the odd world of cartooning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very first frame, Ink Pen invites us to encounter the struggles of Hamhock, the talking pig who tries to make his big break into the biz. But it&amp;rsquo;s a ruthless one that sees him only as a side of the other white meat. We quickly learn that rejection only makes us stronger&amp;hellip; or slightly more stupid. Read and laugh as Hamhock and an array of plucky sidekicks are thrust into danger by careless superheroes and the villains they duel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Red and Rover&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a sweetly funny strip, reminiscent of the relationship of Charlie Brown and Snoopy or Calvin and Hobbes&amp;hellip; Just the book to pick up when you need a booster shot of the warm fuzzies.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;Syracuse Post-Standard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are readers so dedicated to this simple comic about a boy and his dog? That simplicity itself is one of the best-loved characteristics of the strip. Ten-year-old Red and his lab-mix mutt, Rover, are a metaphor for friendship, and their shared adventures hearken back to a simpler time that holds a strong nostalgic appeal for modern readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other feature of Red and Rover that draws fans to the strip is the realness of its character. Rover is not a talking dog; he and Red communicate through thought bubbles. Moreover, Rover&amp;rsquo;s facial expressions and body language are drawn with an authenticity, recognized and lauded by dog lovers, that communicates volumes about what he&amp;rsquo;s thinking and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As proclaimed on the popular family-oriented Web site infodad.com, &amp;ldquo;Well focused, well thought out, and well drawn in something of a &amp;lsquo;retro&amp;rsquo; style, Red and Rover is the most heartwarmingly funny new comic strip in years. Cynics, go elsewhere. Red and Rover is for the rest of us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Almost eight years and 2000 cartoons later, Savage Chickens is now a popular website with millions of readers. Savage still draws every cartoon on yellow sticky notes, and his cartoons cover an eclectic range of topics, including: work, psychology, arachnophobia, pop culture, cats, time travel, love, zombies, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Vix Reynard and the League of Astonishing Vermin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kory Merritt brings together characters from classic children&amp;rsquo;s books to create Vix Reynard and the League of Extraordinary Vermin. Here, familiar faces from the works of E. B. White, Rudyard Kipling, Beatrix Potter, and additional folk and fairy tales take on the role of unlikely heroes fighting to save their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year is 1951, and there&amp;rsquo;s a dark tension in the air. Heroes of legend, some thought only to exist in fairytales, must battle against an evil that threatens the world. Vix Reynard, a wily woman with a proud history of impulsive, daredevil deeds, is given the choice of a lifetime to join the League of Extraordinary Vermin. Her choice may decide the fate of the world, not to mention the League itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
