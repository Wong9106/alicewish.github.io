Aquaman (1962-1978)
Aquaman, the King of the Seven Seas, takes the plunge into his very own series. As the King of Atlantis, Aquaman protects not only his people but also all of Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans from any threat!
Aquaman (1986)
Tragedy catapults Aquaman back to Atlantis, where he discovers that ancient talismans are missing. To prevent a grisly war, Aquaman goes undercover, searching exotic, never-seen underwater civilizations!
Aquaman (1991-1992)
Aquaman has lost everything he holds dear&amp;ndash;his wife, his child, his kingdom&amp;ndash;and is now an obsessed man, driven by non-stop super-heroics as the King of the Seven Seas. He&amp;rsquo;s a man who keeps his pain inside, allowing his anger and sorrow to emerge in violent action!
Aquaman (1994-2001)
The King of the Seas stars in his very own series written by the legendary Peter David (SUPERGIRL, HULK). Whether on land or in the sea, Aquaman battles against foes with a whole-new look and a whole-new status quo!
Aquaman (2003-2006)
In the aftermath of the JLA arc &amp;ldquo;The Obsidian Age,&amp;rdquo; Aquaman is hated by his former subjects and exiled from the life-giving ocean he once called home. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean his quest to protect the oceans of the world at any cost is over any time soon!
Aquaman (2011-2016)
Superstar writer Geoff Johns (GREEN LANTERN) re-teams with artist Ivan Reis (BLACKEST NIGHT) to tell the tale of Justice League founding member Aquaman! But after renouncing the throne of Atlantis, can the former King of the Seas find stability on land?
Aquaman (2016-)
Black Manta returns, and as Aquaman attempts to broker lasting peace between Atlantis and the surface world, his greatest foe engineers a plan to destroy everything and everyone the undersea hero loves.
THEY SAID IT: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to draw a vast undersea world with all the visual flourishes of fantasy and science fiction that it affords,&amp;rdquo; says artist Brad Walker. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve done so much work in outer space-based comics, and I love the freedom that allows.&amp;rdquo;
