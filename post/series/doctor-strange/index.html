Doctor Strange (1968-1969)
Collects Doctor Strange (1968) #169-179 and Avengers (1963) #61.
With the Marvel Age of Comics running full tilt, 1968 brought with it a massive expansion of the Marvel line, and the good Doctor Strange finally landed his own practice. Headed up by no less than Rascally Roy Thomas, paired with the one of the Silver Age&amp;rsquo;s greatest art teams in Gene Colan and Tom Palmer, this trio of talents would take the Master of the Mystic Arts to new horizons beyond our wildest imaginings! It all starts off with the Sorcerer Supreme&amp;rsquo;s tragic origin, followed by the return of the nefarious Nightmare – and then, it goes straight into overdrive as Doctor Strange must face Eternity and Dormammu with the lives of Clea and Victoria Bentley hanging in the balance! But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there! Next comes one of the greatest Doc Strange epics of all as he battles the Sons of Satannish in an adventure that will leave him changed…forever!
Doctor Strange (1974-1987)
When Dr. Stephen Strange, a once gifted but egotistical surgeon, seeks out the Ancient One to heal himself, he sets himself down a path to become Dr. Strange, the Sorceror Supreme!
Doctor Strange (1999)
The latest in the Marvel Knights series takes a bold new look at Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Sorcerer Supreme! A series of bizarre robberies and a spate of spontaneous combustions set Stephen on the trail of an old enemy, and he&amp;rsquo;ll have to employ all his skill to discover the answers! Magic meets noir in an atmospheric Strange tale!
Doctor Strange (2015-)
Who do you call when things are coming out of your dreams and trying to kill you? Or when your daughter is cursing in Latin and walking like a spider? Or when your dog keeps screaming at you to strangle your neighbors? Doctor Strange, of course. He&amp;rsquo;s the only person standing between us and the forces of darkness, but has he been paying his tab?
Doctor Strange (2018-)
SORCERER SUPREME…OF THE GALAXY! The Eye of Agamotto is closed! Doctor Stephen Strange has lost his connection to the Earth’s arcane power, and he can’t wait to recover while nightmares press against the seams of our reality. Tony Stark offers a 21st-century solution: When astral travel fails, try astronautical travel. Enter Doctor Strange: Space-Explorer Supreme! New spells, allies and enemies – new and old – await Strange beyond the stars, along with corners and secrets of the Marvel Universe seen here for the first time! Space is endless, but time is short. After years of threats, Stephen’s bill for magic use is coming due – who will come to collect?!

<p>Doctor Strange (1968-1969)</p>

<p>Collects Doctor Strange (1968) #169-179 and Avengers (1963) #61.</p>

<p>With the Marvel Age of Comics running full tilt, 1968 brought with it a massive expansion of the Marvel line, and the good Doctor Strange finally landed his own practice. Headed up by no less than Rascally Roy Thomas, paired with the one of the Silver Age&rsquo;s greatest art teams in Gene Colan and Tom Palmer, this trio of talents would take the Master of the Mystic Arts to new horizons beyond our wildest imaginings!  It all starts off with the Sorcerer Supreme&rsquo;s tragic origin, followed by the return of the nefarious Nightmare – and then, it goes straight into overdrive as Doctor Strange must face Eternity and Dormammu with the lives of Clea and Victoria Bentley hanging in the balance! But it doesn&rsquo;t stop there! Next comes one of the greatest Doc Strange epics of all as he battles the Sons of Satannish in an adventure that will leave him changed…forever!</p>

<p>Doctor Strange (1974-1987)</p>

<p>When Dr. Stephen Strange, a once gifted but egotistical surgeon, seeks out the Ancient One to heal himself, he sets himself down a path to become Dr. Strange, the Sorceror Supreme!</p>

<p>Doctor Strange (1999)</p>

<p>The latest in the Marvel Knights series takes a bold new look at Marvel&rsquo;s Sorcerer Supreme! A series of bizarre robberies and a spate of spontaneous combustions set Stephen on the trail of an old enemy, and he&rsquo;ll have to employ all his skill to discover the answers! Magic meets noir in an atmospheric Strange tale!</p>

<p>Doctor Strange (2015-)</p>

<p>Who do you call when things are coming out of your dreams and trying to kill you? Or when your daughter is cursing in Latin and walking like a spider? Or when your dog keeps screaming at you to strangle your neighbors? Doctor Strange, of course. He&rsquo;s the only person standing between us and the forces of darkness, but has he been paying his tab?</p>

<p>Doctor Strange (2018-)</p>

<p>SORCERER SUPREME…OF THE GALAXY! The Eye of Agamotto is closed! Doctor Stephen Strange has lost his connection to the Earth’s arcane power, and he can’t wait to recover while nightmares press against the seams of our reality. Tony Stark offers a 21st-century solution: When astral travel fails, try astronautical travel. Enter Doctor Strange: Space-Explorer Supreme! New spells, allies and enemies – new and old – await Strange beyond the stars, along with corners and secrets of the Marvel Universe seen here for the first time! Space is endless, but time is short. After years of threats, Stephen’s bill for magic use is coming due – who will come to collect?!</p>
