Marvel Adventures Super Heroes (2010-2012)
Captain America, Iron Man, the Black Widow, Thor, the Vision, Nova, and the Invisible Woman&amp;hellip;a powerful collective of the greatest heroes the world has ever known. They are the Avengers, and they want it known they&amp;rsquo;re here to stay. But when Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants threaten to destroy several major cities unless their demands for mutant supremacy are met, the Avengers are forced to quit looking to the future, and start hoping to live through the day!
Marvel Adventures: Super Heroes (2008-2010)
It&amp;rsquo;s probably a bad sign when Hercules comes asking for a favor. It&amp;rsquo;s juuuuuust a little job that needs doing, but this is Hercules; isn&amp;rsquo;t he supposed to be REALLY good at doing labors himself? Before they know it, Iron Man, Spider-Man and the Hulk are stuck looking after Orthus and Cerberus, the two legendary hounds of the underworld! Luckily, the dogs learn to behave after chewing up only a few cars, a statue, and Iron Man, and finally they&amp;rsquo;re obedient enough for the Metro Dog Show! Only problem, Hercules wants the dogs back. Oh no, Herc, not before the Hulk gets his ribbon! It&amp;rsquo;s two dogs with five heads between them, and all the action you can handle.
