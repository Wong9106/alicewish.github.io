Faith
Orphaned at a young age, Faith Herbert – a psionically gifted &amp;ldquo;psiot&amp;rdquo; discovered by the Harbinger Foundation – has always aspired to greatness. But now this once ordinary teenager is taking control of her destiny and becoming the hard-hitting hero she&amp;rsquo;s always known she can be – complete with a mild-mannered secret identity, unsuspecting colleagues, and a day job as a reporter that routinely throws into her harms way! Well, at least she thought it would&amp;hellip; When she&amp;rsquo;s not typing up listicals about cat videos, Faith makes a secret transformation to patrol the night as the City of Angels&amp;rsquo; own leading superhero – the sky-soaring Zephyr!
But flying solo is going to be tougher than Zephyr ever thought when she uncovers a deep-rooted alien conspiracy. Two-bit burglars and car thieves are one thing, but when the world needs a hero to stave off a full-blown extraterrestrial invasion, will Faith find herself in over her head&amp;hellip;or ready for her biggest challenge yet?
Faith (2016)
AN ALL-NEW ONGOING SERIES! Because you demanded it&amp;hellip;the high-flying hero that captured the imagination of the world is back with a colossal new comics milestone!
In a city under siege by robots, aliens, monsters and even worse&amp;hellip; celebrities, there is only one woman the people of Los Angeles can count on: the stratospheric superhero called Faith! Aspiring reporter by day and dedicated crime-fighter by night, Faith has tackled every obstacle in her path with confidence – like those crushing deadlines at work, the long-distance boyfriend half a world away, and the missing back issues that plague her comics collection! But, unbeknownst to her, Faith is about to collide with the one force she never saw coming: an up-and-coming super-villain bent on snuffing her out once and for all!
