Plastic Man (1943-1956)
Plas and Woozy break up The Chance Club and must stop the Japanese from stealing a camouflage machine. Later, Professor Goodman takes advantage of a man&amp;rsquo;s disfigurement; and Woozy heads out West to find his fortune after he is conned into buying a map to a goldmine. Scripts and art by Jack Cole.
Plastic Man (1988-1989)
He was the original stretchable superhero of the 1940s, and now PLASTIC MAN is back in an all-new, all-zany four-issue miniseries. How zany is it? Take the stretchable power of the really long arm of the law, add to it his amazing ability to assume any shape under the sun, throw in a liberal dose of sidekick Woozy Winks and some of the wackiest bad guys in town, shake it all up with the creative talents of some of the best that comics has to offer—then double that and you&amp;rsquo;ll have some idea of what to expect in the pages of the PLASTIC MAN miniseries. But wacky isn&amp;rsquo;t all you&amp;rsquo;ll find in PLASTIC MAN. There&amp;rsquo;s also slam-bang action, adventure and pathos—all courtesy of writer Phil Foglio, penciller Hilary Barta and inker John Nyberg, not to mention plot and layout assistance from artist Doug Rice, or a series of “reality checks” provided by artist Kevin Nowlan. What&amp;rsquo;s a “reality check”? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a way of injecting a little bit of the real world into the skewed reality of the realm inhabited by PLASTIC MAN, his friends and foes. PLASTIC MAN—you will believe a man can ply.
Plastic Man (1999)
The JLA&amp;rsquo;s wackiest warrior takes center stage in his own hilarious extra-length special, written by Ty Templeton (BATMAN: GOTHAM ADVENTURES)! In &amp;ldquo;Plastic Fantastic&amp;rdquo; (with art by Aaron Lopresti), our star is transformed into a pop icon courtesy of his super-popular basketball-shoe commercial! Then, in &amp;ldquo;The Secreted Origin of Woozy Winks&amp;rdquo; (with art by Dev Madan and Claude St. Aubin), discover the origins of Plastic Man and Woozy, their past adventures as (sort of) super-spies and the disgusting reason why Mr. Winks is so woozy! Finally, Plas stars in the ultimate crowd-pleasing saga that combines every mega-crossover comic you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen-in eight pages!
Plastic Man (2003-2006)
A retelling of Plastic Man&amp;rsquo;s origin as well as a great new tale that pits Plas against his criminal past!
