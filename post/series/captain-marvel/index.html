Captain Marvel (1968-1979)
Captain Mar-Vell of the Kree Imperial Militia is sent to observe the planet Earth as it is developing technology to travel into space. But, Mar-Vell eventually wearies of his superiors&amp;rsquo; malign intent and allies himself with Earth as the Kree Empire brands him a traitor as Mar-Vell fights to protect Earth from all threats.
Captain Marvel (2000-2002)
He is the son of Mar-Vell, once the greatest warrior the galaxy had ever known. Spawned in a test tube and prematurely aged to maturity, Genis now struggles to fill the boots of his late father- the boots of Captain Marvel. Therein lies the problem. For Genis has inherited his father&amp;rsquo;s greatest gift, the ability of Cosmic Awareness, a oneness with the universe that allows him to know what will happen, what may happen, and what should happen to every living thing in the universe. You might think such knowledge would drive a person mad&amp;hellip;
Captain Marvel (2002-2004)
A new-reader-friendly beginning! Big changes are coming for the son of Mar-Vell, and you can get in on the ground floor right here&amp;hellip;when Cap goes crazy!
Captain Marvel (2008)
From the pages of CIVIL WAR comes the tale of a man out of time! An accident in the Negative Zone propels Captain Marvel from the past to the present day. Now he must come to terms not only with his own impending death, but with the way the world has changed in the time he has been gone.
Captain Marvel (2012-2013)
The &amp;ldquo;Mightiest&amp;rdquo; of Earth&amp;rsquo;s Mightiest Heroes is back! Ace pilot. Legendary Avenger. One hundred percent pure bad-^&amp;amp;*. Carol Danvers has a new name, a new mission - and all the power she needs to make her own life a living hell.
Captain Marvel (2014-2015)
Hero! Pilot! Avenger! Captain Marvel, Earth&amp;rsquo;s Mightiest Hero with death-defying powers and an attitude to match, is back and launching headfirst into her own ongoing series!
Captain Marvel (2016)
It’s a bold new frontier for Carol Danvers as she soars to new heights in her greatest mission yet—leader of the all-new Alpha Flight space program. Yup, Alpha Flight. As earth’s first line of defense, Carol and her team aim to protect the planet from extraterrestrial threats.
Captain Marvel (2017-)

As Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers has traveled to almost every inch of the planet — and beyond! Now she&amp;rsquo;s heading somewhere uncharted! Join Carol on her new cosmic journey through a realm where up is down&amp;hellip;and good is evil! As Carol chases down the the truth about her Kree friend Bean, she&amp;rsquo;ll come face to face with the darkest being in this or any galaxy.
