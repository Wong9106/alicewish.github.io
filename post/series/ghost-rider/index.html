Ghost Rider (1967)
Before Johnny Blaze, before the Spirit of Vengeance, there was Carter Slade &amp;ndash; the first GHOST RIDER, and the world&amp;rsquo;s most mysterious Western hero!
Ghost Rider (1973-1983)
The Spirit of Vengenace rides out of hell, and into his very first ongoing series! The Witch-Woman has risen again, and she won&amp;rsquo;t rest until she&amp;rsquo;s got Johnny Blaze in her clutches!
Ghost Rider (1990-1998)
Danny Ketch is the Ghost Rider, the Spirit of Vengeance! His adventures through hellfire and vengeance start here!
Ghost Rider (2001)
Get out your leather and fire up that hog, because the original Ghost Rider is tearing up the highway once again, and he&amp;rsquo;s badder and wilder than ever! A flaming skull. A cold metal chain. A revved-up Harley. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since Johnny Blaze lived the life of the Ghost Rider. Now he&amp;rsquo;s back, and roaring off on his most insane adventure yet! But this is a wilder, more uncontrollable Spirit of Vengeance than he&amp;rsquo;s ever experienced! So if Johnny wants to live life in the fast lane, he might also end up splattered all over it as roadkill!
Ghost Rider (2005-2006)
The eagerly anticipated series begins here with stunning art and a story that only Garth Ennis could tell. He&amp;rsquo;s paying the price for his deal with the Devil&amp;ndash; is the Ghost Rider condemned to ride the highways of Hell for all eternity? His saving grace could be in the form of an unlikely ally&amp;ndash; an industrious angel with a deal that would free Ghost Rider once and for all! Miss this series at the risk of your very soul!
Ghost Rider (2006-2009)
VICIOUS CYCLE PART 1 Johnny Blaze is trapped in hell, with the Spirit of Vengeance bonded to his immortal soul. But Johnny may have finally found a way out. But at what cost? The Ghost Rider must ride again!
Ghost Rider (2011-2012)
FEAR ITSELF TIE-IN! The Ghost Rider curse is passed onto a new host but Blaze has no idea what nightmares his action has wrought upon the world. Will the new Spirit of Vengeance bring us salvation or send this world of sinners to a flaming death?
Ghost Rider (2016-2017)
ROBBIE REYES IS BACK! It&amp;rsquo;s hell on wheels as the Spirit of Vengeance makes his roaring return! A mysterious object from space crash-lands in southern California, drawing some of the brightest minds in the Marvel Universe to Ghost Rider&amp;rsquo;s backyard – including Amadeus Cho, the Totally Awesome Hulk! What mayhem will be unleashed as the High-octane Hothead comes face-to-face with the Jade Genius? And with Robbie still possessed by the ghost of his evil uncle Eli…who&amp;rsquo;s really in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat? Then, meet the newest speed trap in Ghost Rider&amp;rsquo;s life as his original creators Felipe Smith and Tradd Moore reunite for a special backup story and the debut of an all-new villain. Strap in and start your engines, True Believer, this one&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a scorcher!
