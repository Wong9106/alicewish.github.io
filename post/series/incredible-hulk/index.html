Incredible Hulk (1962-1999)
Is he a man, monster or both? It&amp;rsquo;s the Incredible Hulk, born of a gamma blast that scientist Bruce Banner was caught in.
Incredible Hulk (1999-2007)
Stalking across the depths of the ocean, dispatching everything from sharks to giant squids, comes the Hulk. As a long-buried episode from Bruce Banner&amp;rsquo;s youth begins to surface with possible ramifications for the future, the Hulk finds himself washed up on a strange island, populated by several hapless victims&amp;hellip; and some most unexpected monsters.
Incredible Hulk (2009-2011)
Collects Incredible Hulk (1999) #601-605, Dark Reign: The List - Hulk.
The Hulk is gone, transformed back to mild-mannered Bruce Banner - seemingly forever. But Banner knows the Hulk well enough to realize he never stays buried long. And while the rest of the world breathes a sigh of relief, Banner knows he must prepare - for the day when the monster returns. Traveling to a deserted corner of America, he finds the Hulk&amp;rsquo;s half-alien son Skaar waiting to take revenge on his father. The boy is young, angry&amp;hellip;and powerful. But he&amp;rsquo;s not nearly a match for the Hulk. Not yet, at least. So now it&amp;rsquo;s up to Bruce Banner to train the boy. The lessons will be hard and will see Skaar stand against the greatest fighters in the Marvel Universe: Juggernaut, Wolverine, Daken and more. But there&amp;rsquo;s no room to pull punches because Norman Osborn has decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring back the Hulk. Has Banner trained Skaar enough to play David to Hulk&amp;rsquo;s Goliath and kill him once and for all?
Incredible Hulk (2011-2012)
After Fear Itself, the Hulk has gone into hiding, seemingly safe from a world that hates and fears him. But when government agents come knocking, the Hulk has no choice but to return to war against the one man whose existence threatens the safety of everyone on Earth&amp;hellip;Bruce Banner.
Incredible Hulk (2017-)
Collects Incredible Hulk (2017) #709-713.
Return to Planet Hulk — this time with Amadeus Cho! When Amadeus picks up a distress signal from a distant planet, he&amp;rsquo;s shocked to find out it&amp;rsquo;s from Sakaar. As the Totally Awesome Hulk, Amadeus has been trying to avoid the curse of anger that haunted Bruce Banner. But Sakaar is a place for warriors and gladiators — a place where the Hulk fought brutally in the Imperial Arena. If Amadeus is to survive there, he may have to embrace the savage Hulk within himself — especially when he faces a series of impossible trials known as the Gauntlet! But who sent the mysterious call for help that brought him to this deadly planet? Can Amadeus conquer Sakaar like Banner before him — or will he himself be conquered? And who is that thundering barbarian? Could it be…the Odinson?!
