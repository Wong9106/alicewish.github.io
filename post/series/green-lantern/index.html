Green Lantern (1941-1949)
Alan Scott survives an explosion during a test crossing of a trestle bridge and learns he was saved by the green lantern he carried; The lantern tells how long ago a meteor was formed into a lamp by a Chinese lamp maker and how it protected him from his murderous neighbors; Later the lamp was found by an asylum inmate, who re-formed it into a lantern and was cured of his insanity by the lantern; Now it brings power to Scott, who forms a ring out of part of it and uses his new abilities as Green Lantern.
Green Lantern (1960-1986)
Green Lantern&amp;rsquo;s comic book series made its debut with this issue that introduced the Guardians of The Universe, and a mission to &amp;ldquo;The Planet of Doomed Men!&amp;rdquo; Plus: what is the strange secret of the giant marionette that threatens Coast City?
Green Lantern (1990-2004)
A new Green Lantern is born when freelance artist Kyle Rayner&amp;rsquo;s awarded the last power ring! Can he possibly fill the gap Hal Jordan&amp;rsquo;s collapse into insanity has left in Sector 2814? Of course he can&amp;hellip;but he&amp;rsquo;ll do it with a style all his own!
Green Lantern (2005-2011)
Hal Jordan was chosen to represent an intergalactic police force created by the oldest beings in existence&amp;ndash;the Guardians of the Universe. Protecting Earth and all of space sector 2814 from every extraterrestrial threat imaginable, Hal shines his light proudly as Green Lantern.
