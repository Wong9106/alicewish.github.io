Blood and Honor: The Foreworld Saga Graphic Novels
Collected for the first time: three exciting alternate history graphic novel adventures exploring fantasy, magic, and martial arts in The Foreworld Saga! Including:
Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst&amp;rsquo;s Amazons #1-3:
London, 1914: The leaders of the radical women&amp;rsquo;s rights movement are fugitives from the law. Their last line of defense is the secret society of &amp;ldquo;Amazons&amp;rdquo;: women trained in the martial art of bartitsu and sworn to defend their leaders from arrest and assault.
After a series of daring escapes and battles with the police, the stakes rise dramatically when the Amazons are forced into a deadly game of cat and mouse against an aristocratic, utopian cult&amp;hellip;
The Dead God #1-3:
In the year 536 AD, the land of Frisia is a hostile place of swords and sorcery. Across the dark, cold countryside, three valiant warriors quest for a treasure, the likes of which few can comprehend. These three-the mighty grappler, Eadhild; the skilled archer, Coll; and the charming young Valens-are searching for the head of Yvrnn, the sky-god. For, according to legend, the head of Yvrnn will grant its possessors great wisdom and fortune.
The trio&amp;rsquo;s quest won&amp;rsquo;t be easy, as they must not only contend with Yvrnn&amp;rsquo;s followers who have set obstacles in their paths, but also the mystical creatures and bandits that haunt the roads of Frisia.
Symposium #1-3:
The Shield-Brethren is a secret martial order that has defended the West for centuries. Now, the origins of the order are revealed in this stunning three-issue tale.
Our heroes, seeking to realize the idea offered to them by the philosopher Plato, leave Athens and travel to Delphi with hope of visiting the oracle. They have a dream to found a city of their own, and they desire insight from the oracle as to their question. But their skills-both as warriors and as thinking men-will be tested by adversaries they do not even know they have.
This collection contains explicit material and is intended for mature audiences.
