Macaroni !
The touching story of a child getting to know his grandfather, an Italian immigrant living in Belgium. 11-year-old Romeo thinks of his grandfather as nothing but an &amp;ldquo;old pain-in-the-butt.&amp;rdquo; So when he finds out that he&amp;rsquo;s going to have to spend a few days with him at his crumbling old house, without even a TV to keep him entertained&amp;hellip; well, it&amp;rsquo;s his idea of hell. But there are some surprises in store for Romeo during his visit. He changes his mind about a few things, perhaps thanks to his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s neighbor, Lucy, who tells him about her own &amp;ldquo;nono,&amp;rdquo; and shows him how a spoil tip can be a thing of beauty. Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s thanks to Romeo&amp;rsquo;s dad, who speaks for the first time about his childhood relationship with his father. But it&amp;rsquo;s mostly thanks to Ottavio who, beneath his old, grouchy exterior, conceals the hard life he has led, full of suffering and sacrifice. It is a life the 11-year-old Romeo finds hard to comprehend, but which gives him a deeper understanding of someone from another century. It started off as just a short holiday to a grey Belgian town. But this holiday turns into an opportunity for three generations of men to lift the silence that surrounds them. A touching story about Italian immigration, coal mining, communication between the generations and the difficultly of opening up when you&amp;rsquo;ve spent your whole life in silence.
