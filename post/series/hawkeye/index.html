Hawkeye (1983)
Enthralled in his relationship, Clint opens up to new girlfriend Sheila Danning about his super hero origin. The date ends abruptly when Hawkeye investigates a break-in at Cross Technologies…and the intruder’s none other than Mockingbird! Is Cross Tech involved in illegal affairs that are destroying the environment? Mockingbird seems to think so, and she&amp;rsquo;ll stop at nothing to convince Hawkeye!
Hawkeye (1994)
Collects Hawkeye (1994) #1-4, Hawkeye: Earth&amp;rsquo;s Mightiest Marksman #1 and material From Marvel Comics Presents (1988) #159-161.
The Avenging Archer takes the stage in a collection of enough sensational solo adventures to fill anyone&amp;rsquo;s quiver! First, watch out as Hawkeye encounters a genetically engineered monstrosity created by the insidious Secret Empire. But will this feral fiend prove to be friend or foe? Then, roll with the punches as Hawkeye gets battered by Batroc, assaulted by Oddball and trounced by the Taskmaster - all in a single thrilling one-shot. Finally, duck for cover when Hawkeye participates in a rocky three-part reunion!
Hawkeye (2003-2004)
From carnival roustabout to petty thief to troublemaking hero, one thing about ex-Avenger and Thunderbolt Clint Barton has never changed: he&amp;rsquo;s a sucker for a lost cause. Get ready for exotic locations, offbeat characters, sleazy morals and sleazier motives…and a hero who&amp;rsquo;s not afraid to get his hands dirty.
Hawkeye (2012-2015)
The breakout star of this summer&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster Avengers film, Clint Barton - aka the self-made hero Hawkeye - fights for justice! With ex-Young Avenger Kate Bishop by his side, he&amp;rsquo;s out to prove himself as one of Earth&amp;rsquo;s Mightiest Heroes! SHIELD recruits Clint to intercept a packet of incriminating evidence - before he becomes the most wanted man in the world.
Hawkeye (2016-2018)
Remember Hawkeye? No not that Hawkeye, our favorite Hawkeye, the chick who puts the hawk in Hawkeye, the butt-kicking hero who had to save the other Hawkeye&amp;rsquo;s butt all the time. Yup, you know her, it&amp;rsquo;s the dazzling Kate Bishop making her solo comics debut! Kate is heading west and returning to Los Angeles, with her bow and arrow and P.I. badge in tow. There are crimes to solve and she&amp;rsquo;s the best archer to handle ‘em! The City of Angels has a new guardian angel. The talented duo of Kelly Thompson (A-Force, Jem) and Leonardo Romero (Squadron Supreme, Doctor Strange) bring you a Kate Bishop like you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen her before, in a brand-new ongoing series that really hits the mark!
