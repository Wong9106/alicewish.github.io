Phoebe and Her Unicorn
&amp;ldquo;
One year has passed since Phoebe skipped a rock across a pond, accidentally hit a unicorn in the face, and was granted a single wish—which she used to make the unicorn, Marigold Heavenly Nostrils, her obligational best friend. In some ways, not much has changed. At school Phoebe still clashes with her rival&amp;ndash;and sometimes &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;frenemy&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;he ever-taunting and imperious Dakota. Outside of school, she still fills her free time with extra-credit homework assignments, dramatic monologues about the injustices associated with school cliques, and imaginative conspiracy theories regarding global forces like the &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;powerful construction paper lobby.&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo; But unlike before, Phoebe now has a best friend to share it with—someone to make her laugh and to listen to all her extravagant ideas.
In this second volume of Heavenly Nostrils, titled, Unicorn on a Roll, the reader is invited on a journey into the lives of Phoebe and Marigold as they navigate the difficulties of grade school, celebrate the winter holidays, and explore their super hero/super villain personas together. Join in the fun, as Phoebe competes against Dakota for the leading role of &amp;ldquo;Lisa Ladybug&amp;rdquo; in their fourth-grade play—or as she struggles to &amp;ldquo;manage&amp;rdquo; the PR debacle related to her nose-picking-scandal. (&amp;ldquo;I will neither confirm nor deny the events surrounding Boogergate.&amp;rdquo;) Witness a band of unicorns staging an &amp;ldquo;intervention&amp;rdquo; and learn all the details of Marigold&amp;rsquo;s secret crush on a mysterious creature she has never seen. Perhaps most important, watch as this surprising friendship between a charming, nine-year-old dreamer and a vain, mythical beast forever changes both of them for the better.
