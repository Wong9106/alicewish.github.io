Mister Miracle (1971-1978)
Elite soldier Scott Free escapes Apokolips and comes to Earth, where he assumes the role of Mister Miracle. Inspired by the real-world exploits of Jim Steranko, who was a magician and escape artist prior to his career in comics, Mister Miracle was created by the great Jack Kirby for his epic Fourth World saga.
Mister Miracle (1989-1991)
The adventures of the DC Universe’s greatest escape artist: Mister Miracle! Scott Free and his wife Barda want a normal life, but normal is something a New God really knows little about. Everyday life meets Godly chaos!
Mister Miracle (1996)
Strange and dangerous events unfold when Scott Free/Mr. Miracle undergoes the rite of ascension!
Mister Miracle (2017-)
From the team behind THE SHERIFF OF BABYLON and the Hugo Award-nominated writer of Vision comes a unique new take on one of Jack Kirby’s most beloved New Gods.
Scott Free is the greatest escape artist that ever lived. So great that he escaped Granny Goodness’ gruesome orphanage and the dangers of Apokolips to travel across galaxies and set up a new life on Earth with his wife, the former female fury known as Big Barda. Using the stage alter ego of Mister Miracle, he has made a career for himself showing off his acrobatic escape techniques. He even caught the attention of the Justice League, which counted him among its ranks.
You might say Scott Free has everything&amp;hellip;so why isn’t it enough? Mister Miracle has mastered every illusion, achieved every stunt, pulled off every trick-except one. He has never escaped death. Is it even possible? Our hero is going to have to kill himself if he wants to find out.
Written by Tom King (BATMAN) and illustrated by Mitch Gerads (The Punisher), this is a MISTER MIRACLE unlike any you’ve read before.
