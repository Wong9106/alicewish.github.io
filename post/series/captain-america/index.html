Captain America (1968-1996)
Terrorists have holed up inside the Lincoln Memorial. Their demands don&amp;rsquo;t include getaways or money - they simply want Captain America. And if their demands aren&amp;rsquo;t met, they&amp;rsquo;ll blow themselves up, along with everyone inside the memorial!
Captain America (1996-1998)
Steve Rogers is plagued by terrible nightmares. In his dreams he sees the old war hero Captain America battling Nazis. Who really is Captain America and what does Steve Rogers have to do with him?
Captain America (1998-2002)
Steve Rogers is Captain America. And in this new age, it&amp;rsquo;s up to him and his fellow Avengers to take down all threats, from Hydra to the Skrulls.
Captain America (2002-2004)
It&amp;rsquo;s a new world and Captain America is there to make sure its people are protected.
Captain America (2004-2011)
Steve Rogers was a product of World War II-era American ingenuity and enthusiasm, carrying those ideals into the 21st Century as Captain America. With Cap&amp;rsquo;s mantle (and shield) passed to his former partner, Bucky Barnes, now is the perfect time to jump on to this highly acclaimed series as the new Captain America keeps the dream alive for a new generation! Packed with sprawling battles, beautiful art, resonating themes and pulse-pounding thrills, Captain America is one of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s finest series.
Captain America (2011-2012)
A funeral for a fallen friend turns into a race against time as the original Captain America makes his explosive return!
Captain America (2012-2014)
Thrust into a bizarre, inhospitable world far from home, the all-new, high-adventure, mind-melting, tough-as-nails, sci-fi, pulp-fantasy era of Captain America is NOW! Arnim Zola&amp;rsquo;s ambitions leave Captain America stranded in the upside-down territory known as Dimension Z. With no country and no allies, what&amp;rsquo;s left for the Sentinel of Liberty to protect?
Captain America (2017-)
